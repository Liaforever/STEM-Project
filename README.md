## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Maze Drawing**
   - The maze is represented as a 2D array (`0` = path, `1` = wall).
   - Drawn on an HTML `<canvas>` using the 2D context.

2. **Player Movement**
   - Controlled with the **Arrow Keys** (`↑ ↓ ← →`).
   - Can only move onto open path cells.

3. **Timer**
   - Starts at **3:00 minutes** and counts down.
   - If it hits zero, game ends with `"Time's up!"`.

4. **Win Condition**
   - Player reaches the **red goal cell**.
   - Timer stops, and 3 random facts are displayed.
